# Tilly

<h2>Summary</h2>
Self hostable cloud platform written in JavaScript using Express.js

This project is not fully functional yet. So far, it has functionality for registering, logging in, sharing files, commenting on files, creating and traversing directories and uploading and downloading files (with landing pages for shared files).

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
For my next priority, I hope to implement standard file controls (like you'd find in any file manager). Things like deleting, moving and renaming files. They're not difficult features, but I've been putting those features off because I'm still trying to work out how I would like to design those features, though.
